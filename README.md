# Important
It is with great regret that I have to announce that development work on Mod Menu Template and all pther projects will be permanently stopped. The reason for this is that I'm no longer interested in Android modding scene and due to health and changes in my personal life. And, I have sold my Android phone (now own an iPhone)

I will delete my Telegram account and Github account in 1. november 2024. I will delete everything Android related from my PC forever

Please feel free to fork the project and make improvements, or find other modders who will continue to contribute to this project

The LGL Team Telegram channel will not be deleted since this channel is owned by Spring Musk https://t.me/Layout_musk

Goodbye everyone

# Known bug
- Spinner does not show on some devices running Android 11. Should work again on Android 12
- On some games, menu is using old layout such as Kitkat or Gingerbread when launched without permission. We have not found a way to fix it.

# Getting started
 
See "Docs" folder

# Need help

If you have an issue with Hooking and game crashes, you should go to the **support forums**. Here there are no teachers who can help you with such issues.
