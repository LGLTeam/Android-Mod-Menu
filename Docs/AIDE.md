# Setting up AIDE

Now let's begin

Firstly, make sure you know your phone's hardware, and download correct NDK file coresponding to your phone's CPU architecture. ndk_arm.tar.gz for 32-bit/ARMv7 phones, ndk_arm64.tar.gz for 64-bit/ARM64 phones. Installing incorrect version will cause problems

Now install NDK support for modded AIDE. Click on 3 dots on the right-corner. Click **More... - Settings**

Go to **Build & Run**, and click on **Manage native code support**.

A prompt will ask to input the path of NDK file.

If you use X-plore, you can show details of the file and copy file path easly.

An option **Open Android app Project** will appear. Click on it to open

# Run the app

Press play to compile the project

If successful, it will ask you to install the APK. It may ask you to allow installation from unknown sources. Please allow when asked

Run the app

# AIDE Troubleshooting

Problem with the project like app crashes: click **More... -> Project -> Refresh Build**. This will clear the project cache and fix problems

Problem with AIDE: Open System Settings -> Apps and clear data of AIDE app. This will reset everything and you need to install NDK again

AIDE has a lot of compatibility issues, you need to research a lot and do some trial and errors until you fix something.
